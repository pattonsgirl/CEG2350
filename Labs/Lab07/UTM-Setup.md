2. If you would like to use Kali Linux, use this [link](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) for the download and make sure you use the Apple Silicon (ARM64) tab and click the one in the center that says *Recommended* when downloading
3. If you would like to use Ubuntu, use this [link](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) and click the green download button

### Part 3 - Setting up the Virtual Machine

### Shutting Down the VM

2. You want to treat this like another computer and click your profile
3. Click *Shut Down*
