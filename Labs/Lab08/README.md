## Lab Procedure

**THIS LAB MUST BE COMPLETED IN THE AWS INSTANCE YOU SETUP IN LAB 01.**

[Return to here and select "Start Lab"](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/68834/modules/items/6128516)

Use `ssh` to connect to your AWS Ubuntu instance.

Go to the folder that contains your repository (likely named `ceg2350-yourgithubusername`).

Create a new directory, `Lab08`

Write answers in `README.md` the [LabTemplate.md is here](LabTemplate.md).

- [Raw version of LabTemplate.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pattonsgirl/CEG2350/main/Labs/Lab08/LabTemplate.md)

For each part below, you will be asked to do an action or answer a question. The actions are going to be commands - you will write the command you used as "answers" to the action requested. You are allowed to use multiple commands to solve an action. Just write down all that were needed to complete. Check with the TAs if you need clarification.

If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.

## Part 1 - What do we have?

Your AWS instances have one block device in use - `xvda`.  In this section, you will explore commands view partition and filesystem information about `xvda`.  **Do not make any modification to `xvda`.**

Hint, remember that disk devices are in the `/dev/` folder  

- **Useful Commands: `lsblk`, `parted`, `blkid`, `df`, `cat`**

For tasks that ask you to use a command, write the command used and include the output of the command.

1. Use `lsblk` to list only information about the `xvda` block device.
2. Use `parted` to print the partition table of the `xvda` block device.
3. For the `xvda` partition table:
    - Does it use MBR or GPT?
    - How many partitions are on the block device?
    - What is the largest partition?
4. Use `blkid` to view information of `xvda` and it's partitions.  Play with `*` to get all matches that start with `\dev\xvda`  
5. For the partition with the root filesystem:
    - What is the device name?
    - What is the partition label?
    - What type of filesystem is on the partition?
6. Use `df` to view file system disk space usage in human readable format (meaning it prints MB/KB/GB)
7. For the root filesystem:
    - What is the total size?
    - How much space is used?
    - Where is it mounted to?
8. View the contents of the filesystem table in `/etc/fstab`
9. Explain fields & purpose of fields in the entry that mounts the root filesystem.

## Part 2 - Something new

You have had an unformatted disk available on your AWS instance all along.  Time to create a partition table and a partition on it (and in the next step create a filesystem).  The disk is `xvdb` - you can see it, but that it has no partitions, if you run `lsblk`.

- **Useful Commands: `df`, `lsblk`, `blkid`, `gdisk`**

1. Using the `gdisk` GPT partition table manipulator, find out what the following main menu options do:
   - `p`
   - `o`
   - `n`
   - `i`
   - `w`
2. Edit the `xvdb` block device with `gdisk`. Using the main menu, configure the disk to use the GPT partition table type, have at least 1 partition, and have that partition use the Linux filesystem type. Save your changes to the disk.
    - This will be the only partition, so it can use the recommended sizes, which is to say, start at the end of the GPT partition table, and span to the last block of the disk.
3. Partition table of `xvdb`
4. Answer the following about `xvdb` in its current state:
    - What is the device name of the only partition?
    - What is the size of the only partition?
    - What filesystem type will be used on the only partition?

## Part 3 - File it away

Now that you have a partition, you can create a filesystem on it in order to interact with it to store and organize files and create permissions for the files.

- **Useful Commands: `mkfs`, `mount`**

1. Make an `ext4` filesystem on the partition on `xvdb`
2. Use `blkid` to view information of the partition on `xvdb`
3. Make a directory in `/mnt/` named `newworld`
4. Mount the partition on `xvdb` to `newworld`
5. In `newworld` create some files and directories
6. `umount` the partition on `xvdb`
7. When can I interact with files on the filesystem on the partition in `xvdb`?

## Part 4 - Take a `fstab` at this

Right now, every time you want to access your filesystem, you need to mount it - this includes after rebooting the system.  It would be handy to have it auto-mount.  The filesystem table file - `fstab` is a file that stores  information about wat to mount when the system boots.  You task in this part is to **append** a new entry to the file to automount your filesystem on the partition on `xvdb`.

1. Make a backup of the current version of `/etc/fstab` to `/etc/fstab.bak`
2. Add a line to `/etc/fstab` to mount the partition on `xvdb` to the mount point (`/mnt/newworld`)
3. Test your changes using `mount -a` to mount / remount records according to `etc/fstab` and use commands to validate your entry worked
4. **If you do not think your changes are correct** restore `/etc/fstab` from `/etc/fstab.bak`.  If you think they are correct, you may leave your changes in place.

## Part 5 - What is dead may still be read

When you delete a file, you are used to it no longer being accessible, or to it still being temporarily available / recoverable via the Recycle Bin.  But once you can't open it anymore, it should be gone, including from the disk, right?  Right?!?

This part will have you acknowledge that to truly make data gone and no longer readable, there are extra steps involved.  The general recommendation is to trust nothing, and take disks that have had important data on it, like tax returns, credit card info, passwords, etc, taken to a shredding center and properly ripped to computer-illegible pieces.

We are also only focused on data stored on disks for this exercise.  If you look into this topic of data forensics, there is another prong of this that focusing on making sure RAM is cleared of information.

- **Useful Commands: `mount`, `strings`**

1. On the filesystem you created on the `xvdb` partition, create **two** files, each with a different FAKE secret about you.
2. What does the `strings` command do?  If you referred to an internet resource, make sure you cite it by including the URL.
3. Run `strings` on the filesystem partition on `xvdb` - read through the output and make an analysis about what output you are viewing.
4. Delete **one** of the files with a secret. 
5. Run `strings` on the filesystem partition on `xvdb` - read through the output and determine if the secret, while no longer accessible via the filesystem, is still readable on the partition.
6. Use `shred` to overwrite the contents of your second secret file on the disk.  Write a short report of steps and provide proof that the file is no longer readable on the disk or accessible in the filesystem.  Include an explanation of flags used.

## Extra Credit - Create a Virtual Filesystem

Now that you have made a virtual machine, a thought might be how does it use the disk space on your host.  In the context of a virtual machine, the reserved space on the host has a partition table, partitions, and a filesystem mounted to `/`

Write the commands used in each step (unless otherwise stated).

1. Use **either** `dd` or `fallocate` to reserve 2 GB of space from `/dev/xvda`.  
2. Write an explanation of the command you used.
2. Make a filesystem on the reserved space.
3. Mount the filesystem to `/mnt/vfs`.
