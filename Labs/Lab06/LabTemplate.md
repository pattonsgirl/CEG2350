## Part 4 - `dotinstall` Usage Guide

THIS SHOULD ALL BE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ONLY YOUR USAGE GUIDE TEXT

Examples of script usage and output. This should be enough info that  
you can hand this and the script to someone not in this course and they  
would be able to understand what your script does and how to use it.

Use good markdown so that this documentation is pretty and clean on GitHub.

Below is kind of how I would format things

### What it is

Describe your script in plain English, nothing too technical.  Think about this as describing what you made over the dinner table.

### How to run it

If someone wanted to downloaded your script, what steps would they take to have their own copy that they could run
1. Numbers followed by a space
2. Create numeric lists
3. Don't forget `code snips` can go in backticks.

### Examples

```
Two examples using your script to rename an existing file
By using the triple quotes, you can enclose a block of code
And code blocks look very professional
```

## Citations

To add citations, provide the site and a summary of what it assisted you with.  If generative AI was used, include which generative AI system was used and what prompt(s) you fed it.  Generative AI may not write your script for you, only assist with component and how to type questions.
