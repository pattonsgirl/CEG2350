## Lab Procedure

[Return to here and select "Start Lab"](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/68834/modules/items/6128516)

Use `ssh` to connect to your AWS Ubuntu instance.

Go to the folder that contains your repository (likely named `ceg2350-yourgithubusername`).

Create a new directory, `Lab06`

This lab may have you creating input files, scripts, and output files. All of your work should be found here.

Some questions will need you to write answers in `README.md` the [LabTemplate.md is here](LabTemplate.md).

- [Raw version of LabTemplate.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pattonsgirl/CEG2350/main/Labs/Lab06/LabTemplate.md)

If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.

## Part 1 - Name Change Script

The following will ask you to write a script that changes a file's name.  The script will allow the user to provide the search pattern to replace, and the replacement for the found pattern.  A sample of using the script, where `namechange` is the name of the script file:

```
namechange -f find-pattern -r replace-with filename
```

1. Create a script in your `Lab06` folder named `namechange`. 
2. Create some files in your folder with common errors (spaces in the filename, a misspelling, etc.).  You can utilize the [createfiles.sh](createfiles.sh) script to generate them.
   - Sample file name "errors":
      - `.jpg` is misspelled as `.jgp`
      - spaces in file names that could be replaced with `-`
      - file names with `foo` in them need to become `bar`


**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**  

- You must have a **minimum** of **3 (THREE) COMMITS** made for this script.  Your commit messages must describe what's currently working / tested.  When (after which steps / testing) you make a commit is your choice.

**Implement the following features in the `namechange` script:**

1. Create a function called `printHelp`. `printHelp` should output the following:

```
Usage: namechange -f find -r replace "string to modify"
 -f The text to find in the filename
 -r The replacement text for the new filename
```

2. Use `getopts` to read in options and save arguments that correlate with options. `getopts` should support the following options in the `OPTSTRING`

   - `-h`
     - call `printHelp` function and exit script
   - `-f`
     - option followed by argument specifying pattern to find in the filename
   - `-r`
     - option followed by argument specifying what to replace the found pattern with in the filename
   - `\?`
     - use as case when option is not part of `OPTSTRING`
     - call `printHelp` and exit script
   - there are `getopts` demos linked in resources, as well as in this folder
     - [getopts-basics.sh](getopts-basics.sh)
     - [cfgetopts.sh](cfgetopts.sh)
     - Before panicking, keep in mind that `getopts` is mostly a `switch` statement on steriods.  Play with the demos given to understand what is happening

3. If no `filename` was provided OR if `filename` does not exist:
   - Output `User must provide valid filename`
   - Call the `printHelp` function

4. Using argument in field `filename`, find the pattern to be replaced and replace it with the pattern requested using `sed`
   - Hint: remember to enable extended regular expressions with `sed` to use the `-E` flag
   
5. Rename the `filename` specified with the fixed name string after using `sed` to replace the bad pattern in the file name.

```
# Sample runs of working script

$ bash namechange -h
Usage: namechange -f find -r replace filename
 -f The text to find in the filename
 -r The replacement text for the new filename

$ bash namechange -f "\s" -r "-" "hello world.md"
Renamed "hello world.md" to hello-world.md

$ bash namechange -f "er+" -r "error" spellingerrrr.txt
Renamed spellingerrrr.txt to spellingerror.txt
```

## Part 2 - Retrospective

1. How would you explain `getopts` to a friend?
2. What did you get stuck on while working on this script?  How did you overcome it?
3. What feature would you add to this script?

## Part 3 - Usage Guide

Fill out the Usage Guide section in your lab template.  It should contain a minimum of the following:
1. Information on what your script is and how users should copy and use your script
2. Examples of script usage and output
3. Use good markdown so that this documentation is pretty and clean when viewed on GitHub.

**Resources**
- [GitHub markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Examples of bad README / Usage Guides:
- [bash wordle](https://gist.github.com/huytd/6a1a6a7b34a0d0abcac00b47e3d01513)
   - as discussed in class there was a hidden dependency of a word file, we needed to make it executable, and what if you didn't know how to play wordle?

Examples of good README / Usage Guides:
- [pokeget](https://github.com/talwat/pokeget)
   - this is far more thorough than what you are writing, but note here how much detail in included.

## Extra Credit - Bulk Name Changer

This builds on the script created for Part 1. Since the core is similar, I would `cp` this to a new script named `bulkrenamer`.

1. Download and run one of the create files scripts to generate some dummy files for this part.
   - [createfiles.sh](createfiles.sh) will just create 30 files in the directory you run it from (10 of each error type below)
   - [cfargs.sh](cfargs.sh) will let you create a number of files with the error type of your choice (spaces or spelling) in the directory you specify
   - [cfgetopts.sh](cfgetopts.sh) will let you do the same as `cfargs.sh`, but with options
   - Errors in these file names that can be corrected with a script:
     - `jpg` is misspelled as `jgp`
     - spaces in file names that could be replaced with `-`
     - files with `foo` in them need to become `bar`
2. The script will run as: `bulkrenamer -f find-pattern -r replace-with FILES_TO_RENAME*`
3. For each file given (or all files in a given folder), rename according to the find / replace arguments provided.

## Submission

1. Verify that your GitHub repo has a `Lab06` folder with at minimum:

   - `README.md` (Retrospective responses & `namechange` Usage Guide)
   - `namechange` (script)

### `getopts` and error handling

I don't not require any error handling outside of the sample program runs provided. However...

If you are reading this, you may have noted that `getopts` still doesn't solve all user abuse cases by default.

For example, `getopts` can have a hard time "detecting" a missing argument after an option. `bash namechanger -r -fâ€‹` would not "count" as `-r` missing an argument, because `OPTARG` would read `-f` as the argument for `-r`. Fun right?

There are many ways to detangle this problem, some using `getopts`. You could play some quick games before running `getopts`, such as checking number of arguments passed... It isn't failsafe, but it would help.

So let's use what we have - stored values in variables. And we have an ability to check if those values contain anything... catch my drift? Check out the second answer in this post: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/50563/how-can-i-detect-that-no-options-were-passed-with-getopts

There are games you can play within the case statement to do this check, but it's a little clunky. If you're curious: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43425556/getopts-behaves-not-as-expected-when-option-parameter-is-missing
