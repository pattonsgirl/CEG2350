## Lab Procedure

Make sure to return to the AWS Learner Lab page (link in Pilot if you forgot to bookmark it) and hit "Start Lab" to turn on your sandbox / AWS instance.

Use `ssh` to connect to your AWS Ubuntu instance.

Go to the folder that contains your repository (likely named `ceg2350-yourgithubusername`).

Create a new directory, `Lab06`.

Create a file named `README.md` in the `Lab06` folder.  Copy into the file the contents of the [Lab 06 Template](LabTemplate.md).

- [Raw version of LabTemplate.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pattonsgirl/CEG2350/main/Labs/Lab06/LabTemplate.md)

You may refer to additional resources outside of the recommended resources provided.  

Any resource that you use that contributes to your understanding of exercises in this lab should be cited in the `Citations` section of your lab answers.  To add citations, provide the site and a summary of what it assisted you with.  If generative AI was used, include which generative AI system was used and what prompt(s) you fed it.

If you make mistakes with commands in the lab, note them!  Writing down what went wrong and what the correction was will significantly help your learning journey.  If you cannot find a correction, it will help the TAs or myself understand what point you reached and determine some potential solutions.

## Part 1 - bash aliases

Craft an `alias` with a name of your choice that pipes a `fortune` to a `cowsay` cow of your choice (`-f` flag)

Craft an `alias` with a name of your choice to something "fun".  Checkout these as suggestions.  You may need to install these programs first with `apt`.
   - `curl wttr.in`
   - `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl`
   - have `cat` use `lolcat` instead
   - `asciiaquarium` 

Add the aliases to a file named `.bash_aliases` in your user's home directory.

Append the following to the end of your user's `.bashrc` file:

```
if [ -e $HOME/.bash_aliases ]; then
    source $HOME/.bash_aliases
fi
```

Confirm that the changes in these files continuously make the aliases available to your user's account.

## Extra Credit - Dotfile Repository

Create a new **public repository** in **your GitHub account** named `dotfiles`.

Add your `.bash_aliases` file to your `dotfiles` repository.

Add your `dotinstall` script to your `dotfiles` repository.

Confirm that, when cloned, your `dotinstall` successfully performs it's taskings.
- For testing, you could use your `first-initial-last-name` user account your made on the instance back in Lab 02.  Remember if you clone a GitHub repository to a new account, you'll need to set up a key pair and add the public key to your GitHub user account Settings.

Create a `README.md` file for your `dotfiles` repository describing what's inside.

## Part 2 - Dotfile Installer Script

Your tasking is to write a script 
```
namechange -f find-pattern -r replace-with filename
```

1. Create a script in your `Lab06` folder named `namechange`. 
2. Create some files in your folder with common errors (spaces in the filename, a misspelling, etc.).  You can utilize the [createfiles.sh](createfiles.sh) script to generate them.
   - Sample file name "errors":
      - `.jpg` is misspelled as `.jgp`
      - spaces in file names that could be replaced with `-`
      - file names with `foo` in them need to become `bar`


**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**  

- You must have a **minimum** of **3 (THREE) COMMITS** made for this script.  Your commit messages must describe what's currently working / tested.  When (after which steps / testing) you make a commit is your choice.

**Implement the following features in the `namechange` script:**

1. Create a function called `printHelp`. `printHelp` should output the following:

```
Usage: namechange -f find -r replace "string to modify"
 -f The text to find in the filename
 -r The replacement text for the new filename
```

2. Use `getopts` to read in options and save arguments that correlate with options. `getopts` should support the following options in the `OPTSTRING`

   - `-h`
     - call `printHelp` function and exit script
   - `-f`
     - option followed by argument specifying pattern to find in the filename
   - `-r`
     - option followed by argument specifying what to replace the found pattern with in the filename
   - `\?`
     - use as case when option is not part of `OPTSTRING`
     - call `printHelp` and exit script
   - there are `getopts` demos linked in resources, as well as in this folder
     - [getopts-basics.sh](getopts-basics.sh)
     - [cfgetopts.sh](cfgetopts.sh)
     - Before panicking, keep in mind that `getopts` is mostly a `switch` statement on steriods.  Play with the demos given to understand what is happening

3. If no `filename` was provided OR if `filename` does not exist:
   - Output `User must provide valid filename`
   - Call the `printHelp` function

4. Using argument in field `filename`, find the pattern to be replaced and replace it with the pattern requested using `sed`
   - Hint: remember to enable extended regular expressions with `sed` to use the `-E` flag
   
5. Rename the `filename` specified with the fixed name string after using `sed` to replace the bad pattern in the file name.

```
# Sample runs of working script

$ bash namechange -h
Usage: namechange -f find -r replace filename
 -f The text to find in the filename
 -r The replacement text for the new filename

$ bash namechange -f "\s" -r "-" "hello world.md"
Renamed "hello world.md" to hello-world.md

$ bash namechange -f "er+" -r "error" spellingerrrr.txt
Renamed spellingerrrr.txt to spellingerror.txt
```

## Part 3 - Retrospective

1. How would you explain `getopts` to a friend?
2. What did you get stuck on while working on this script?  How did you overcome it?
3. What feature would you add to this script?

## Part 4 - Usage Guide

Fill out the Usage Guide section in your lab template.  It should contain a minimum of the following:
1. Information on what your script is and how users should copy and use your script
2. Examples of script usage and output
3. Use good markdown so that this documentation is pretty and clean when viewed on GitHub.

**Resources**
- [GitHub markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Examples of bad README / Usage Guides:
- [bash wordle](https://gist.github.com/huytd/6a1a6a7b34a0d0abcac00b47e3d01513)
   - as discussed in class there was a hidden dependency of a word file, we needed to make it executable, and what if you didn't know how to play wordle?

Examples of good README / Usage Guides:
- [pokeget](https://github.com/talwat/pokeget)
   - this is far more thorough than what you are writing, but note here how much detail in included.

## Submission

1. Verify that your GitHub repo has a `Lab06` folder with at minimum:

   - `README.md` (Retrospective responses & `dotinstall` Usage Guide)
   - `dotinstall` (script)

2. In the Pilot Dropbox, paste the URL to the `Lab06` folder in your GitHub repo
   - URL should look like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/ceg2350-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/tree/main/Lab06

### `getopts` and error handling

I don't not require any error handling outside of the sample program runs provided. However...

If you are reading this, you may have noted that `getopts` still doesn't solve all user abuse cases by default.

For example, `getopts` can have a hard time "detecting" a missing argument after an option. `bash namechanger -r -fâ€‹` would not "count" as `-r` missing an argument, because `OPTARG` would read `-f` as the argument for `-r`. Fun right?

There are many ways to detangle this problem, some using `getopts`. You could play some quick games before running `getopts`, such as checking number of arguments passed... It isn't failsafe, but it would help.

So let's use what we have - stored values in variables. And we have an ability to check if those values contain anything... catch my drift? Check out the second answer in this post: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/50563/how-can-i-detect-that-no-options-were-passed-with-getopts

There are games you can play within the case statement to do this check, but it's a little clunky. If you're curious: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43425556/getopts-behaves-not-as-expected-when-option-parameter-is-missing
