## Lab Procedure

[Return to here and select "Start Lab"](https://awsacademy.instructure.com/courses/68834/modules/items/6128516)

Use `ssh` to connect to your AWS Ubuntu instance.

Go to the folder that contains your repository (likely named `ceg2350-yourgithubusername`).

Create a new directory, `Lab03`

This lab will have you creating input files, scripts, and output files. All of your work should be found in your `Lab03` folder.

Some questions will need you to write answers in `Lab03.md` the [LabTemplate.md is here](LabTemplate.md).

- [Raw version of LabTemplate.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pattonsgirl/CEG2350/main/Labs/Lab03/LabTemplate.md)

For each part below, you will be asked to do an action or answer a question. The actions are going to be commands - you will write the command you used as "answers" to the action requested. You are allowed to use multiple commands to solve an action. Just write down all that were needed to complete. Check with the TAs if you need clarification.

If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences - writing them down will help you ask good questions later.


## Part 1 - clone wars

`ssh` to your AWS instance for this part. It is highly recommended you look at the Resources listed below.

- **Useful commands for this part: `ssh-keygen`, `cat`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`**

1. Create an SSH key pair on your AWS Ubuntu instance.
2. Add the public key to GitHub
3. Clone your repository (a.k.a. repo) to the `ubuntu` user's home directory

- [GitHub - Adding SSH key to your GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

## Part 2 - git going

- **Useful commands for this part: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git status`**

1. In your repository folder (the folder you `clone`d from GitHub), create a folder named `Lab02`
2. In the `Lab02` folder, create a file named `Lab02.md`
3. Paste the contents of the [LabTemplate.md](LabTemplate.md) into this file
   - [Link to raw LabTemplate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pattonsgirl/CEG2350/main/Labs/Lab02/LabTemplate.md)
4. `add` `Lab02.md` for tracking, `commit` changes as you go, `push` to synchronize with GitHub, and `pull` if you make an edit in GitHub and need to synchronize your cloned folder
5. Fill in the Part 1 Answers with a simple guide for taking a new, locally created file in your repository, and syncing it with GitHub.

Reminder: if you make edits to your repository in GitHub using the browser, you'll need to `pull` to sync content in your `clone`d repository.

   - yes, there are more git commands than are on this sheet 

## Part 1 - `config` your connection

On your local system (`exit` from your AWS instance), you used an SSH command to log on to your AWS Ubuntu instance. There is a neat configuration file that can be used to create an alias of sorts. Read the resources for this section, then configure the `.ssh/config` file for your user on your system with information on your `ssh` connection to your AWS instance.

1. Write the command you have been using to `ssh` in to your AWS instance.
2. Provide the HostName (IP address) of your AWS Ubuntu instance:
3. Provide the user name that you are logging on to the system with:
4. Provide the absolute / full path to the private key (Identity File) on your local system:
5. On your local system, edit `~/.ssh/config` to contain an entry with information about logging on to your AWS Ubuntu instance.  Note that the answer template wants the contents you wrote to the file.
6. Write the new form of the `ssh` command to connect to your AWS instance.

- The `Port`, if you wish to include it in your `config` is `22`


## Part 2 - IO Redirection

Find out what each command (including its flags) does and write a description beside it.  Don't forget to lookup commands & flags using `man` and / or some Google-fu (ability to use Google search) to find out. All of the commands can be run - a note is included if there is any additional setup to make it work.

Sample:
  - `echo "This is easy" > button`
  - Full credit: `echo` prints "This is easy" to standard output, which is redirected to the file named `button` in the current directory.  `button` now contains the text, "This is easy".

1. `printenv HOME > thishouse`
2. `cat doesnotexist 2>> hush.txt`
3. `cat nums.txt | sort -n >> all_nums.txt`
    - To run: create a file named `nums.txt` containing random numbers, each on a new line
4. `cat << "DONE" > here.txt`
5. `ls -lt ~ | head`
6. `history | grep ".md"`

## Part 3 - Rolling the Dice

Use your AWS instance for this part since your repository is cloned there and `ssh` authentication with GitHub should be set up.  But I'm just a set of instructions with good advice.

The overall goal is to create a script that randomly generates a set of random numbers within the range specified by the script user.  In steps 1 - 5, assume you are rolling one die.

To complete the overall task, perform the steps listed below.  **After each step is complete and tested**, create a `commit` with your changes.  `push` `commit`s as you wish, just remember the `push` saves all the `commit`s to the mighty GitHub cloud.  **Your `commit` message must include which task you completed.**

If you don't make it through all of a step or don't complete all 6 steps, leave heavy comments for partial credit considerations.

1. Create a bash script named `roll`.  Output a random number between 1 and 20.
    - Script should run when `./roll` OR `bash roll` is typed on command line.  Think about permissions.
    - Output should say: `You rolled a ##`, where `##` is the randomly generated number.

2. Change script to prompt the user for a number.  If the number is less than 1, output an error message.  Output a random number between 1 and the user's number.

3. Change script to take an argument from the command line instead of prompting the user.  If no argument is passed, output an error message.  Output a random number between 1 and the argument passed.
    - Script should run when `./roll ##` is typed on command line, where `##` is a number

4. Change script to also check if the given argument is greater than 1.  If no argument was given, prompt user for a number, and check that it was greater than 1.  Output a random number between 1 and the number.

5. Change the script to prompt the user for a valid number if the argument was not provided or was not greater than 1.  Prompting continues until a number greater than 1 is given.  Output a random number between 1 and the valid number.

6. Change script to take **two** arguments from the command line.  The first argument will indicate number of dice to roll.  The second will indicate how many sides of the dice.  If there are less than or more than two arguments, or if the arguments are not greater than one, prompt the user for valid values for number of dice and number of side.  Output a random number between 1 and the number of sides for each die.
    - Script should run when `./roll ## ##` is typed on command line.
    - Output should say: `Die 1 rolled a ##    Die 2 rolled a ##`, where `##` are two randomly generated numbers, one for each die.

## Part 4 - Retrospective

A retrospective is a moment of refection after a task.

1. Where and when did it go wrong while working on your script tasks?
2. Was anything familiar working with a new language compared to one you are used to?
3. Assuming you `push`ed your `commit`s to GitHub, view your `commit` history.  Did you write good `commit` messages that refer to what tasks were completed at each commit?  What would you improve?

## Part 5 - .profile and PATH

Use your AWS instance for this part since your repository is cloned there and that is where your script should be.

The overall goal is to, from any directory, able to refer to your script by name, `roll`, and have your script execute.  To do so, `roll` needs to have the correct permissions **and** be located in a directory listed in `PATH`.

In this part, your task is to read `~/.profile` and focus on the `if` statements that would change the value of `PATH`, **if** one of the statements was `true`.

DO NOT MODIFY THE CONTENT of the `.profile` file.  Right now, both conditions evaluate to `false`. 
  - Think about how you could confirm that statement - that both conditions are currently `false`.
  - Remember, the `test` command is what is being used when you see `[` (square brackets).  
  - The flag / relational condition being checked is an option of the `test` command.

1. What is the value of the `PATH` environment variable?

2. Read through `ubuntu`'s `~/.profile`.  Pick one condition to make `true` that, if `true`, will add the directory to be part of the `PATH` variable.  What needs to happen to make the condition `true` (what currently **does not exist**)?

3. Based on your evaluation above, use commands to create what is necessary to have the condition evaluate to `true`.

4. Reload / run the statements in `~/.profile` either with `source` or by logging out and `ssh`ing back in. 
  - What is the value of the `PATH` environment variable? 
  - What was added now vs. in your answer to question 1?

5. Copy `roll` into the folder. Write the command(s) used.
  - Note: for added fun, do a symbolic link or hard link to the original script.  Not going to show you how yet, but try Google-ing to see if you can crack it.

6. Modify the script's permissions and / or interpreter so that you can run your script on the command line from any location. Write the modification explanations and commands needed.
    - You can now run `roll` (without the leading `./` or `bash`) from anywhere
    - Note: if you already modified permissions, fill in this question with what you modified since scripts are not executable by default.

7. In terms of user, group, and other, explain who is allowed to run the script.

## Extra Credit - Room for Improvement

Make a notable improvement to the `roll` script.  This could be another feature, an additional boundary check on allowed conditions, experimenting with colored text for standard and error output... If you have an idea, you are encouraged to run it by the TAs first to make sure it is worthy.

Make sure you `commit` and `push` your script changes for grading and add a note of what you did in the answer template.
