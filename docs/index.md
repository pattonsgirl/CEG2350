### Communication:  

Pilot will be used in this course for submitting labs and for accessing course materials and grades. 
- Pilot - [https://pilot.wright.edu](https://pilot.wright.edu)

This course makes heavy usage of Discord for communication in and outside of class.  It is strongly advised to keep an eye on Discord conversations for additional resources and troubleshooting assistance.
- Wright State CSE Discord Server: [https://discord.gg/pMUMzTt ](https://discord.gg/pMUMzTt)
    - Click the #ceg-class-selection channel under the Information category.  Click to join CEG 2350 - OS Concepts and Design.
    - Verified accounts will have green or gold font in their username, depending on roles in the server

It is the student's responsibility to check the Pilot site, and their Wright State email for major course announcements. Students should also do a daily check of conversation in the course Discord server for additional useful resources, explanations, and clarifications. 

### Grading:  

Lab assignments: 60% (12 planned labs, 5% each) 

Quizzes: 10% (10 planned, 1% each) 

Exams: 30% (3 exams – two during the semester & the final exam, 10% each)  

**No makeup exams** are given unless there is a verifiable emergency. Missing any of the course exams may result in a meeting with the instructor and earning no more than a D in the course. 

The **final exam** is a cumulative test of your understanding of topics in this course.  Receiving a failing grade (less than 70%) on the final exam may result in a review of your overall course performance and a meeting with the instructor to discuss your understanding and ability to apply the core course concepts and determine your final course grade

You may miss (receive a 0) on no more than two **lab assignments**.  Each lab will cover a different topic and will be your primary time to practice and reinforce course concepts.  If more than two labs are missed, you may earn no more than a D in the course. 

**AWS Checkins** will occur throughout the term.  Your labs in the course will request you utilize a virtual machine hosted on AWS.  Failure to pass the first first in will result in a conversation to make sure the usage and expectations are understood.  Failure to pass the second or third check in will result in a meeting with the instructor to determine your understanding of the course materials and require one or more demonstrations to prove ability to implement lab taskings. If the demonstrations do not prove competency or understanding, the instructor may determine the student will earn no more than a D in the course.

If you have a personal concern about grading, course progress, extensions requests, etc. - please send an email to the course instructor.

The grading scale for the course is [90-100] A; [80-90) B; [70-80) C; [60-69) D; [0-60) F*  

*Final assigned grade is at the discretion of the instructor. 

### Attendance Policy: 

Attendance will not be taken for this course.  This is an in-person course, and you are expected to attend all sessions.  If you need to miss a class for illness or other personal reasons, it is your responsibility to catch up on topics and practice activities. 

Access to an archive of course lectures from Spring 2023 is given via Content -> Course Video Archive -> Panopto - Spring 2023 Videos w/ Captions.  The videos are captioned and searchable for specific content.  The videos can be used for additional review or more practice exercises. The videos are not a subsitute for regular attendance.

### Assignment \ Quiz \ Exam Policy:  

Students are responsible for keeping up with due dates.  Specific dates are given in the Dropbox and Quizzes & Exams sections of Pilot. **No late work will be accepted**. If you need to request an extension due to personal circumstance, you may make a request to the course instructor.

URLs to lab work must be submitted via the Dropbox on Pilot. Be sure insert your link into the text field and then click submit. If you do not receive an email confirmation, then your work was not properly submitted. Be sure to allow enough time to submit your work before the Dropbox closes. Personal computer issues/loss of data/not allowing enough upload time are not valid justifications to merit an extension of the deadline. 

Exams will be given in person.  Quizzes will be available online and may be taken outside of class.  Dates for both will be announced with ample time.  If the student requires any change / extension they are responsible for notifying the instructor as soon as possible. 

### Lab Redo Policy: 

There will be two lab assignment redo opportunities given during this course. These opportunities can be for a missed lab, lab with a low grade, or missed portions (including extra credit portions).  Specific details will be announced during the course. 

### Students with disabilities:  

Any student with a disability (physical or mental) must register with the Office of Disability Services to determine what accommodation(s), if any, are appropriate. The student must inform the instructor of the special accommodation(s) needed as soon as possible. The student is responsible for scheduling time extension accomidations with the ODS Proctoring Center.

### Technology Requirements:  

This course requires you to have access to a computer and the internet. If your personal system becomes unavailable, there are options around campus to provide access to a system.

CECS has two open computer labs – 152B & D open 24/7. 

There are several open computer lab options across campus – primarily in the library & library annex.  A full list can be found on the [CaTS Computer Labs Page](https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/computer-labs)

Laptops2Go (by CaTS) can be an option if you need a system during a school day. [Laptops2Go—Laptop Check Out Service](https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/laptops2golaptop-check-out-service)

In the event none of these options can solve your needs, please contact the instructor via email as soon as possible.   

### CSE Help Room:  

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering maintains a help room, staffed by upper-level students, for students in introductory programming classes.  The help room is not intended to help with this course, but many students working in the help room have taken this course and may be available to assist you.  You should first use the course Discord channel, contact your TAs, and contact the instructor before attempting to use the help room staff. 

A virtual help room is available via the Department’s Discord server.  In the “WSU Computer Science Department” Discord server, select the “CS Help Room” channel.  Here you can make a post to “cs-help-room" to list your questions or request one-on-one support with voice or screen sharing. 

### Tutoring Services & Study Coaches: 

Tutoring Services provides individual and small group academic support for a wide range of courses. Students can meet with an individual tutor by appointment for frequently requested courses numbered 3000 and below.  

Students who want to develop strategies and skills specific to their needs for all their courses can meet by appointment with a Peer Academic Coach. [Peer Academic Coaching](https://www.wright.edu/student-success/academic-support/peer-academic-coaching) is an excellent way to get personalized solutions to the challenges of online and in-person courses. 

For students to sign up for appointments, follow the link on the website [www.wright.edu/tutoring](https://www.wright.edu/student-success/academic-support/tutoring-services) to the Tutoring Services Online Request form. Once the form is received, their front desk staff will be in contact regarding their appointment status. Appointments are free and are set for one hour each week through the last week of classes. 

### Academic misconduct:  

Labs, quizzes, and exams are to be completed individually. Sharing your work or copying someone else's work or plagiarizing from online resources will result in a penalty for the assignment(s) and a formal Academic Integrity Violation will be submitted. Your labs will allow you to cite sources used for the assignment - if you have questions on how to properly cite to protect or display your personal understanding ask your course instructor.

The assignments in this course are designed to develop the student’s ‘own’ voice and perspective through troubleshooting & testing of their knowledge. The use of AI of any kind in these types of assignments would undermine that work, its purpose, and ultimately any benefit that it could provide towards your learning experience. Therefore, the use of any generative AI to help with your assignments will be considered the same as getting help from another person, that is, plagiarism, and will be penalized accordingly.  

If sufficient evidence is found, use of AI tools or plagarism may exact one of the below penalties depending on the assignment:
- Lab assignments may result in a minimum of a 0 on the assignment and a formal Academic Integrity Violation will be submitted.  
- Exams will result in a minimum of a 0 for the exam and a formal Academic Integrity Violation will be submitted.  
- Final exam will result in an F in the course and a formal Academic Integrity Violation will be submitted

This policy will be discussed in the classroom at the beginning of the semester. Further questions and comments are welcome and should be addressed to the course instructor during the class. 

The university policy on academic misconduct can be found at [http://www.wright.edu/students/judicial/integrity.html](http://www.wright.edu/students/judicial/integrity.html)
