Lab this week:
- Show wget to get data.
- Pull up reference resources.
    - Regex cheatsheet: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Cheatsheet
    - Grep to search for patterns: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-grep-command-to-search-files-in-linux/
    - Sed to find and replace: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-string-in-files/
- Problem solving strategy.  Build regex first (regex101.com), then try in grep (remember the -E flag!), then move to sed / awk
- Focus more on giving time to start constucting regex queries

Maybe awk Thursday: https://linuxize.com/post/awk-command/ or new resource: https://www.howtogeek.com/text-filtering-uses-for-the-linux-awk-command/

Demo of what getopts looks like (Thursday stretch goal): https://zerotomastery.io/blog/bash-getopts/

Things to highlight - no formatting for Lab 05, no credit.
