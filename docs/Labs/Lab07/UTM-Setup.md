### Part 2 - Choosing What VM
You must download the **.iso** file of whatever VM you would like to create and install!

2. If you would like to use Kali Linux, use this [link](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) for the download and make sure you use the Apple Silicon (ARM64) tab and click the one in the center that says *Recommended* when downloading
3. If you would like to use Ubuntu, use this [link](https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm) and click the green download button

### Part 3 - Setting up the Virtual Machine

1. Once the application is up and running, you want to click *Create a New Virtual Machine*

### Part 5 - Shutting Down the VM
1. Once you have things booted up and you played around and you are done, **DO NOT JUST CLICK THE X IN THE TOP RIGHT CORNER** because this can corrupt your VM
2. You want to treat this like another computer and click your profile
3. Click *Shut Down*
