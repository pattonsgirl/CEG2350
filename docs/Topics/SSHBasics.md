# SSH Basics

SSH is a protocol used for:
- providing secure access for users and automated processes
- interactive and automated file transfers
- issuing remote commands
- managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components

In this course we will focus on using SSH for 
- authentication (key pairs)
- establishing a secure connection to a remote system (virtual machine running in AWS)
- securely transfaring files (pushing with `git` and `sftp`)
