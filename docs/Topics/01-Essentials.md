### Overview of Core OSes
> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

[Timeline of Operating Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_operating_systems)

This course will be discussing OSes for Personal Computers (PCs). Therefore our conversations will focus on Linux, Windows, and Mac. You will specifically be learning about OS Concepts and Usage through Linux based Operating Systems.

Key takeaways:
- What are the requirements behind the different OSes (what hardware can they run on)
- What are the file system structure differences

### Command Line Navigation

First off, know the terminology differences between a [terminal, console, shell, and command line](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line)

**Terminal**:  
> Terminal: A software application (emulator) that simulates a physical terminal, allowing interaction with the system from anywhere, even remotely. 

- Windows Terminal [Windows]
- Terminal [Mac]
- GNOME Terminal, Konsole, etc [Linux]

**Console**:
> Console: The original hardware (monitor/keyboard) directly linked to the computer, used for primary system access, boot messages, and low-level tasks. 

> Video game systems are called "consoles" because the term originally described a self-contained control panel or unit that consolidated electronic functions, fitting early game devices like the Magnavox Odyssey, and the name stuck as it distinguished them from general-purpose computers, even as they evolved into dedicated gaming machines with a fixed purpose

**Command Line Shells**:

Command Line Interface:  
> A CLI is a method of user interaction where the user types commands as lines of text to operate software or the operating system, rather than using visual elements like icons and buttons.

Command Line Shell: 
> The specific program that interprets the commands typed into the CLI, executes the corresponding tasks, and manages the interaction between the user and the operating system's kernel. While the term "shell" often implies a command-line interpreter in Unix-like systems, technically a desktop environment like Windows Explorer can also be considered a graphical "shell" (GUI). 

- Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) - default for most Linux OSes
- Zsh (Z Shell) - default for most macOS systems (tied with bash)
- Powershell- default for Windows, now cross-platform
- `cd`, `ssh`, and `git` are all considered command line interfaces
