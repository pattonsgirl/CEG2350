## 02 - Bash

- File manipulation
- Scripting
- Path & environment variables
- Regular Expressions
- grep, sed, awk

### PATH & environment variables

**Core Commands:**
- `which`
- `whereis`
- `env`

### File manipulation

**Core Commands**
- `sort`
- `cut`
- `wc`
- `paste`
- `join`
- `head` / `tail`
- `less` / `more`
- Streams - standard input, standard output, and standard error (2)
- `>` vs `>>` vs `>>>`
- `<`
- `|`
- doubles quotes `"`, single quotes `'`, and backticks \`

#### Functional Control

In Bash, quoting is less about "style" and more about **functional control**. Choosing the wrong quote can be the difference between printing a variable's value and printing the literal name of the variable.

---

#### 1. Single Quotes (`' '`): The Literal String

Single quotes are the "hands-off" option. They preserve the **literal value** of every character within the quotes. Bash will not interpret variables, backslashes, or commands.

* **Use case:** When you want exactly what you typed, no exceptions.

```bash
NAME="Gemini"
echo 'Hello $NAME' 
# Output: Hello $NAME

```

> **Note:** You cannot put a single quote inside single quotes, even with a backslash.

---

#### 2. Double Quotes (`" "`): The Interpretive String

Double quotes are "flexible." They protect the string from being split by spaces (word splitting), but they still allow the shell to interpret specific special characters like `$`, ```, and `\`.

* **Use case:** When you want to include variables or command results within a string.

```bash
NAME="Gemini"
echo "Hello $NAME"
# Output: Hello Gemini

```

##### The Difference in Action:

| Feature | Single Quotes (`'`) | Double Quotes (`"`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Variable Expansion (`$VAR`)** | No (Literal) | **Yes** |
| **Command Substitution** | No (Literal) | **Yes** |
| **Backslash Escapes** | No (Literal) | **Yes** |

---

#### 3. Backticks (`` ``): The Command Substitution

Backticks are used to execute a command and capture its output into a variable or another string.

* **Modern Alternative:** While backticks still work, the modern standard is `$(command)`. It is preferred because it is easier to nest (put a command inside a command).

```bash
# Using Backticks
CURRENT_DIR=`pwd`

# Using Modern Syntax (Recommended)
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)

echo "You are currently in: $CURRENT_DIR"

```

---

#### The "Final Boss" Demo

Here is a single script that demonstrates how these three interact:

```bash
USER_COUNT=$(who | wc -l) # Command substitution

# 1. Double Quotes: Expands the variable
echo "There are $USER_COUNT users logged in."
# Output: There are 3 users logged in.

# 2. Single Quotes: Treats everything as text
echo 'The variable is written as $USER_COUNT'
# Output: The variable is written as $USER_COUNT

# 3. Mixing them: Using backticks inside double quotes
echo "Today is `date`"
# Output: Today is Tue Jan 27 13:21:19 EST 2026

# 3. (Modern style) Mixing them: Using backticks inside double quotes
echo "Today is $(date)"
# Output: Today is Tue Jan 27 13:21:19 EST 2026

```

**Why does this matter?**

If you have a filename with a space, like `My Resume.pdf`, and you try to run `ls $FILE` without double quotes, Bash will look for two files: `My` and `Resume.pdf`. Using `ls "$FILE"` ensures Bash treats it as one single item.

### Regular Expressions

A regular expression (regex for short) allow developers to match strings against a pattern, extract submatch information, or simply test if the string conforms to that pattern.

> Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

#### 🚩 The Basics: Characters & Anchors

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.` | **Wildcard**: Matches any single character except newline. | `b.t` matches `bat`, `bet`, `bit`. |
| `^` | **Start**: Matches the beginning of a line. | `^Hello` matches "Hello world". |
| `$` | **End**: Matches the end of a line. | `bye$` matches "See ya, bye". |
| `\` | **Escape**: Lets you search for special characters like `.` or `*`. | `\.com` matches ".com". |
| ` \| ` | **OR**: Matches the pattern on the left or the right. |

---

#### 🔢 Quantifiers: "How many?"

* `*` : **0 or more** (The "greedy" one).
* `+` : **1 or more** (At least one must exist).
* `?` : **0 or 1** (Makes the character optional).
* `{n}` : **Exactly n** times (e.g., `\d{3}` matches 3 digits).
* `{n,m}` : **Between n and m** times.

---

#### 📦 Character Classes & Shorthand

| Shorthand | Meaning | Equivalent To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\d` | Any **Digit** | `[0-9]` |
| `\D` | Any **Non-digit** | `[^0-9]` |
| `\w` | Any **Word character** | `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` |
| `\W` | Any **Non-word character** | (symbols, spaces, etc.) |
| `\s` | Any **Whitespace** | (space, tab, newline) |
| `[abc]` | **Set**: Matches any char in brackets | `a`, `b`, or `c` |
| `[^abc]` | **Negated Set**: Matches anything *except*... | Everything but `a`, `b`, or `c` |

### Grep, sed, and awk

**When to use which**
- Use `grep` if you want to find or filter lines.
- Use `sed` if you want to change or delete text.
- Use `awk` for data/column manipulation. 
    - If your text looks like a table (like a CSV or log file), awk is usually the fastest tool for the job

---

#### 1. grep: The Search Engine

`grep` (Global Regular Expression Print) is used to find lines that match a specific pattern. It’s your "Find" command on steroids.

**Simple Demos:**

* **Search for a word in a file:**
`grep "error" system.log`
* **Case-insensitive search (`-i`):**
`grep -i "apple" fruit.txt` (Finds Apple, APPLE, or apple)
* **Search and show line numbers (`-n`):**
`grep -n "TODO" script.sh`
* **Invert search (`-v`):**
`grep -v "success" results.txt` (Shows everything *except* lines containing "success")

**Pro Tip: Piping to grep**

You’ll often use grep to filter the output of other commands using the pipe `|`:

```bash
# List all files, but only show the .pdf ones
ls -l | grep ".pdf"

```

---

#### 2. sed: The Stream Editor

`sed` is used to **transform** or edit text. While it can do many things, its most common use is "search and replace."

**The basic syntax:**

`sed 's/old_text/new_text/' filename`

**Simple Demos:**

* **Replace the first occurrence on each line:**
`sed 's/brown/red/' colors.txt`
* **Global replacement (`g`):**
`sed 's/brown/red/g' colors.txt` (Replaces *every* "brown" in the file)
* **Delete a line containing a pattern:**
`sed '/temporary/d' list.txt`
* **Edit the file in place (`-i`):**
`sed -i 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/g' config.conf` (Warning: This changes the actual file!)

---

## 4. Combining Them

Imagine you have a configuration file, and you want to find all lines related to "Port" and change the port from `8080` to `9000`.

```bash
# First, use grep to see what we are working with
grep "Port" config.sys

# Now, use sed to change it
sed -i 's/8080/9000/g' config.sys

```

**The Power of RegEx**

Both commands use **Regular Expressions (RegEx)**. For example:

* `grep "^Start"` finds lines *beginning* with "Start".
* `grep "end$"` finds lines *ending* with "end".


#### 5. awk - pattern scanning and processing language

By default, `awk` sees every line as a collection of fields separated by whitespace.

**The Basics: Printing Columns**

`awk` uses `$1`, `$2`, etc., to refer to the first, second, or -th column. `$0` refers to the entire line.

```bash
# Example input: "John Doe 25"
echo "John Doe 25" | awk '{print $1, $3}'
# Output: John 25

```

---

**Changing the Delimiter (`-F`)**

If your data isn't separated by spaces (like a CSV or the system `/etc/passwd` file), you tell `awk` what the "Field Separator" is using `-F`.

```bash
# Print the usernames from the system password file (separated by :)
awk -F ":" '{print $1}' /etc/passwd

```

---

**Filtering and Math**

`awk` is actually a full programming language, so it can do things `grep` can't, like checking if a number in a specific column is greater than a certain value.

* **Find lines where the 3rd column is greater than 100:**
`awk '$3 > 100' data.txt`
* **Find a word AND print a specific column:**
`awk '/Error/ {print $5}' system.log` (Finds lines with "Error", prints 5th word)

---

**Built-in Variables: `NR` and `NF`**

* `NR` (Number of Records): The current line number.
* `NF` (Number of Fields): The count of columns in the current line.

```bash
# Print the line number followed by the first column
awk '{print NR, $1}' list.txt

# Print only lines that have exactly 3 columns
awk 'NF == 3' list.txt

```

### Scripting

#### 1. Shebang

Every Bash script should start with a Shebang. This tells the system which interpreter to use.

shebang is the combination of the `#` (pound key) and `!` (exclamation
mark)​

When it is the first two bytes of an executable (`x` mode) file, is
interpreted by the `execve`(2) system call (which executes programs)​

- `#!/bin/sh`
    – Execute the file using the Bourne shell, or a compatible shell,
assumed to be in the /bin directory​
- `#!/bin/bash`
    – Execute the file using the Bash shell​
- `#!/usr/bin/pwsh`
    – Execute the file using PowerShell​
- `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
    – Execute with a Python interpreter, using the
env program search path to find it​

---

#### 2. Variables

No spaces around the = sign!

- Correct: `CITY="Dayton"`
- Wrong: `CITY = "Dayton"`

**Quote your variables:** Use `"$VAR"` instead of `$VAR` to prevent errors if the variable contains spaces.

**Accessing variables:** Use the `$` sign: `echo $NAME`.

**Arguments:** These are inputs passed when you run the script (e.g., `./script.sh hello 123`).

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$0` | The name of the script itself |
| `$1` to `$9` | The first through ninth arguments |
| `$#` | The number of arguments passed |
| `$@` | All arguments as a single list |

---

#### 3. Conditionals and `test`

The `if` statement uses the `test` command (often written as `[ ]`) to evaluate expressions.

It is increasingly common for devs to default to the extended `test` command (often written as `[[ ]]`)

**Pro-tip:** Always put spaces inside the brackets: `[ $A == $B ]`. The brackets are representing the `test` command, which is using the values in the brackets as space separated arguments. 

**Common `test` Operators:**

* **Strings:** `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `-z` (is empty).
* **Numbers:** `-eq` (equal), `-ne` (not equal), `-gt` (greater than), `-lt` (less than).
* **Files:** `-f` (is a file), `-d` (is a directory).

If/Else Syntax:

```bash
if [ "$1" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "That's a big number."
elif [ "$1" -eq 10 ]; then
  echo "Exactly ten."
else
  echo "Too small."
fi

```

---

#### 4. Loops: For and While

Loops allow you to iterate over lists of data or run commands until a condition is met.

For Loop (Iterating over a list):

```bash
for ITEM in Apple Banana Cherry; do
  echo "I like $ITEMs"
done

```

While Loop (Running until a condition changes):

```bash
COUNT=1
while [ $COUNT -le 3 ]; do
  echo "Count is $COUNT"
  ((COUNT++))
done

```

---

#### 5. Functions

Functions keep your code "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself). They don't take formal parameters in the parentheses; instead, they use the same `$1`, `$2` logic as the main script.

```bash
greet_user() {
  echo "Hello, $1! You are looking at the $2 directory."
}

# Calling the function
greet_user "Admin" "/home/user"

```

---

#### 6. Exit codes

**Exit Codes:** Scripts return `0` for success and non-zero for failure. You can manually set this with `exit 1`.

#### 7. Comments

**Comments:** Use `#` to explain *why* you're doing something, not just *what* the code does.

#### 8. Arguments & Scoping

This is a common point of confusion because Bash uses the same "positional parameters" (`$1`, `$2`, etc.) for both the script itself and the functions inside it.

The best way to visualize this is as **nested layers of scope**. When you are inside a function, the "global" script arguments are temporarily hidden by the function’s "local" arguments.

---

**Script Arguments (Global Scope)**

When you run a script from the terminal, the values you type after the filename are assigned to `$1`, `$2`, and so on. These are available anywhere in the script **except** inside a function that has been called with its own arguments.

**Example:** `./deploy.sh production web-server`

* `$1` is `production`
* `$2` is `web-server`

---

**Function Arguments (Local Scope)**

When you call a function, you can pass it data just like you pass data to a script. Once inside that function, `$1` no longer refers to the script's first argument; it refers to the **function's** first argument.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the function
check_status() {
  # Inside here, $1 is the argument passed TO THE FUNCTION
  echo "Function argument 1: $1"
}

# Main script logic
echo "Script argument 1: $1"

# Call the function with a specific string
check_status "Internal-Task"

```

If you ran this as `./script.sh External-Input`, the output would be:

1. `Script argument 1: External-Input`
2. `Function argument 1: Internal-Task`

---

**Passing Script Arguments into Functions**

If a function needs to know what was passed to the script, you must explicitly "pass them down" the chain.

| Method | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `my_func "$1"` | Passes only the first script argument to the function. |
| `my_func "$@"` | Passes **all** script arguments to the function. |
| `my_func "static" "$2"` | Passes a hardcoded string as `$1` and the script's second argument as `$2`. |

**Practical Demo: The "Downstream" Effect**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

log_message() {
  local LEVEL=$1  # 'INFO' or 'ERROR'
  local MSG=$2    # The actual message
  echo "[$LEVEL] $MSG"
}

# We take the user's input from the script argument ($1) 
# and pass it into the function as the second argument ($2)
log_message "INFO" "User entered: $1"

```

---

**Key Differences Summary**

| Feature | Script Arguments | Function Arguments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source** | The user/terminal | The script itself (the caller) |
| **Lifetime** | Exists for the whole script run | Exists only while function is running |
| **Variable `$0**` | The script name | **Still** the script name (not the function name) |
| **Access** | Direct | Indirect (must be passed in) |

> **Pro Tip:** Use the `local` keyword for variables inside functions (e.g., `local MY_VAR="value"`). This prevents the function from accidentally overwriting variables in the rest of your script.

#### 9. Advanced utilities

As your scripts get more professional, you’ll want to stop relying on the order of arguments (like `$1`, `$2`) and start using **flags** (like `-f file.txt` or `-v`).

The `getopts` command is the built-in Bash tool for parsing these options. It’s cleaner, handles errors automatically, and lets your users provide arguments in any order.

---

**How `getopts` Works**

`getopts` works in a `while` loop, stepping through each flag it finds.

* **The Optstring:** This is the string of allowed letters (e.g., `af:v`).
* A letter followed by a colon `:` means that flag **requires** an argument (e.g., `-f filename`).
* A letter without a colon is a standalone flag (e.g., `-v` for verbose).


* **The Variables:**
* `$OPTARG`: Holds the value of the argument (if the flag has a colon).
* `$OPTIND`: A counter that keeps track of the argument position (useful for cleanup).



---

** The `getopts` Template**

Here is a robust demo script that handles a "Name" argument and a "Verbose" toggle.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize variables with defaults
NAME="Guest"
VERBOSE=false

# The colon at the start ":n:v" enables "silent error reporting"
# n: means -n takes an argument
# v  means -v is just a toggle
while getopts ":n:v" opt; do
  case $opt in
    n)
      NAME="$OPTARG"
      ;;
    v)
      VERBOSE=true
      ;;
    \?)
      echo "Invalid option: -$OPTARG" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
    :)
      echo "Option -$OPTARG requires an argument." >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
done

# Shift away the parsed options so $1, $2 etc. refer to 
# any remaining non-flag arguments
shift $((OPTIND -1))

# Now we use our variables
if [ "$VERBOSE" = true ]; then
  echo "Verbose mode is ON."
fi

echo "Hello, $NAME!"

```

---

**Why the `shift` at the end?**

After `getopts` finishes, the internal counter `$OPTIND` points to the next "unprocessed" argument. If you run:
`./script.sh -n "Alice" README.txt`

`getopts` handles the `-n "Alice"` part. By running `shift $((OPTIND -1))`, you effectively "throw away" the flags you just processed. This makes `README.txt` become the new `$1`, allowing you to mix flags and file paths easily.

---

**Summary of `getopts` Syntax**

| Character | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | Flag without argument | `-a` |
| `a:` | Flag with required argument | `-a "some value"` |
| `:` (at start) | Silent error mode | Prevents Bash from printing its own errors |
| `\?` | Catch-all for unknown flags | Handles `-z` (if not defined) |
| `:` (in case) | Missing argument error | Handles `-n` with nothing after it |

**Quick Comparison**

* **Positional (`$1`):** Good for quick, simple scripts where you always know the order.
* **`getopts`:** Best for tools meant for others to use, where readability and flexible ordering matter.
