# Git and GitHub Basics

## What is git?
> Git (/ɡɪt/) is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers  
collaboratively developing source code during software development.
Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers  
contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other  
distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a  
full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a  
central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the  
distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides  
access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous  
integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

TLDR: It is a remote server that hosts git repositories, and has a custom set of features added on top to improve the  
developer / development experience.  You have a git repository hosted on GitHub for use in this course.


## git vs GitHub

A quick aside: git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by  
developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate  
with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives  
to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred  
to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will  
make sharing your code with others easier.
